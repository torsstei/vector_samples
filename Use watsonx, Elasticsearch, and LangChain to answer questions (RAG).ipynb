    "This notebook contains the steps and code to demonstrate support of Retrieval Augumented Generation in watsonx.ai. It introduces commands for data retrieval, knowledge base building & querying, and model testing.\n",

    "#### About Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a versatile pattern that can unlock a number of use cases requiring factual recall of information, such as querying a knowledge base in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, RAG requires 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and index a knowledge base passages (once) - In this case here Elasticsearch\n",
    "- Retrieve relevant passage(s) from knowledge base\n",
    "- Generate a response by feeding user prompt augmented by the retrieved passages into a large language model\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain simplifies these stepsby providng convenience wrappers for the first step and for the combination of second and third step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",

There , on November 25 , 1969 , the LAPD confiscated a door on which someone had written `` Helter Scelter ( sic ) is coming down fast . '' A photograph shows the confiscated door was also inscribed with `` 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 -- ALL GOOD CHILDREN ( Go to Heaven ? ) '' ( sic ) . This children 's rhyme is heard in `` You Never Give Me Your Money '' , a song that appears on Abbey Road . In October 1970 , the prosecution offered testimony about the door during Manson 's trial for the Tate - LaBianca murders ; but only the `` Helter Skelter '' inscription seems to have been noted . In late September or early October 1969 , before the arrests , Tex Watson had left the desert camp and gone on to separate himself from the Family . Late in the separation , he , too , bought a cassette recording of Abbey Road . Walking for miles across the desert to rejoin the Family in late October , he played his tape continuously to see what The Beatles might have to tell him . When , at the last moment , he turned back , an old prospector informed him the arrests had taken place . Watson returned to his native Texas\",\n",

The game was played on February 3 , 2013 , at Mercedes - Benz Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . This was the tenth Super Bowl to be played in New Orleans , equaling Miami 's record of ten in an individual city . For the first time in Super Bowl history , the game featured two brothers coaching against each other -- Jim and John Harbaugh , head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens , respectively -- earning it the nickname Harbaugh Bowl . In addition , Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games ( Baltimore , 1 -- 0 ; San Francisco , 5 -- 0 ) . The 49ers , who posted a regular - season record of 11 -- 4 -- 1 , entered the game seeking their sixth Super Bowl win in team history ( and first since Super Bowl XXIX at the end of the 1994 season ) , which would have tied the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by a franchise .

During the second half of the 19th century , the city 's population increased dramatically , and a new period of urban development began . During this period , gas lighting , horse - drawn trams , and limited electrification were introduced . The Dâmbovița River was also massively channelled in 1883 , thus putting a stop to previously endemic floods like the 1865 flooding of Bucharest . The Fortifications of Bucharest were built . The extravagant architecture and cosmopolitan high culture of this period won Bucharest the nickname of `` Little Paris '' ( Micul Paris ) of the east , with Calea Victoriei as its Champs - Élysées . I.C. Brătianu Boulevard in the 1930s Between 6 December 1916 and November 1918 , the city was occupied by German forces as a result of the Battle of Bucharest , with the official capital temporarily moved to Iași , in the Moldavia region .
